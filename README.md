GitShow uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Firebase] - A Backend-as-a-Service solution both for mobile and web-based applications that includes services for building, testing, and managing apps.
- [Github API] - API to create integrations, retrieve data, and automate your workflows through Github.

## Contributing üöÄ

> Currently, we are in the initial phase of building the application.
> To minimise bugs, we are not accepting any contributions as of now.
> But, you can always raise issues, so that we can work on it.
> And probably in the future, you can work on adding new features with us!
